# Operating Instructions

## Steps

1. When you first enter, there is no data displayed. You can choose to use the default data to view the overall display effect. It is recommended to import your own data for operation. The steps are as follows:

    a. Personnel Configuration - Personnel List - Download Template, download the data template and modify to fill in data (please note that the table header cannot be modified).

    b. After modification, click 'Upload File' on the same page to upload the modified Excel table.

2. Enter the prize configuration and modify your prize information. The name should be as short as possible for easy display; whether everyone participates means whether this prize is drawn from all personnel (those who have already won can still participate); the number of winners refers to the number of people to be drawn for this prize; the number of winners cannot be edited; when 'drawn' is selected, it means the prize has been used, and deselecting it will reset the prize, but will not reset the winners; the image is the prize image displayed on the homepage (you can upload it yourself in the image list); the left icon is used to adjust the prize order.

After completing the above two items, you can use it normally.
